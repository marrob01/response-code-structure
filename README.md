# Response-Code-Structure

# Acme Company - Contact Us Page

## Name Section

 I will create a text field with an unlimted amount of space so every name will fit.
 
  **Questions -**
  1. Will each name be unuique?
  2. Is there a certain format you would like the names to be in (ex: first,last or last,first)? Placeholders will be added to the text field so the user clearly      sees how to format thier names. 
  
## Phone Number Section

## Emal Section

I will create a text field with an unlimted amount of space so every email will fit. Because each deparment depends on the email entered its best to have emails follow a certain format so it can be routed to the correct deparment. For example my email could be **acmemarcus123@sales.com**, that would be routed to the Sales deparment because of **@sales.com**. Using this convention would be easy for the user to know how to proprely type thier email taht matches its deparment. A place holder will also be added in the text field so users can see beforehad how to properly type thier emails.

If a user enters in a email that dosen't match the corect deparment, an error will be shown above the email text box reminding the user to use a email that corresponds to the correct deparment. 

 **Questions -**
  1. best email formating?

## Department Section

 I will create a dropdown menu of the list of aliavble deparments for the user to select from. This way no typing is done by the user and ensures there will be no errors when selecting the correct deparment. 
 
 **Questions -**
  1. Is it safe to say for each deparment a different type of email is associated with it? For example, if my deparment is Sales my email must be associated with the sales deparment.

## Message Section

 I will create an expandable text field to type in that has a limit on how many characters can be typed. This way it can prevent any messages that is to long.

 **Questions -**
  1. Will your users who use this form need to send anything other than just text. For example someone may need to send  a PDF, CSV, txt file, etc ... If so, it      is possible to add a feature to attach files and text in the message section.
  2. Is there a limit on how long a message should be? If there is, please let me know.

# Additional Features  
* If you want to give your customer the option add files or text such as PDF, CSV, txt, etc ... It would be easier and neat for the user to have seprate section under messages to attach a file. That would also be faster for my development team rather than doing this all in the message section. 

* I understand in the future you might have to add an adtional deparment yourself which also means another email to also consider. One way I can take care of this is to make an admin login that allows you to create as many deparments as you need. At the same time you will be able to create a new type of email routed to your new deparment. This way it is secure, it prevents someone who dosent have admin access to create a new deparment and gmail. By doing it this way, it will be clear to you how to create content without editing the source code. With an admin accout on your website its also possible to edit other parts of your site and or your contact form per your request. More details explained in the dpearment and email sections.

# Technology Recommendations
To craete this form I strongly recommend

# General Understanding 
* Upon a user succesfully completeing this form then clicking send/submit, where is this form data being sent to? Do you want it to sent to a email, a internal source, etc..? This is very important because this contact form data needs to be sent to somewhere so you can view it.
