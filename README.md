## Message Section

 For the message box, I will make an expandable field to type in that has a limit on how many characters can be typed. This way it can prevent any messages that is to long.

 **Questions -**
  1. Will your custmors who use this form need to send anything other than just text. For example someone may need to send  a PDF, CSV, txt, etc ... If so, it is       possible to add a feature to attach files and text in the message section.
  2. Is there a limit on how long a message should be? If there is, please let me know.

# Additional Features  
* If you want to give your customer the option add files or text such as PDF, CSV, txt, etc ... It would be easier and neat for the user to have seprate section under messages to attach a file. That would also be faster for my development team rather than doing this all in the message section. 

* I understand in the future you might have to add an adtional deparment yourself which also means another email to also consider. One way I can take care of this is to make an admin login that allows you to create as many deparments as you need. At the same time you will be able to create a new type of email routed to your new deparment. This way it is secure, it prevents someone who dosent have admin access to create a new deparment and gmail. By doing it this way, it will be clear to you how to create content without editing the source code. More explained in the email and deparment section.
